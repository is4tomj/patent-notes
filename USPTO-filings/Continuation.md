Recommended Process and Documents to file a Continuation Application
================================================

Two ways to file a Continuation Application: 
1.  Regular method (preferred and slightly cheaper).
2.  File by reference (should be used for emergencies only).

##  1. Regular method (preferred and slightly cheaper)

This method is preferred because the filing process is pretty much the same as filing a new application.

### Documents

- Specification:
  - Written description with benefit claim **that disclaims any previous qualifications or statements**;
  - New claims;
  - I like to change the title of a continuation, but I do that in a preliminary amendment; otherwise the title may not match.
- Drawings;
- WebADS (or regular ADS, but that is prone to user error);
- Declaration(s);
- Fees;
- If the original application was filed before September 16, 2012, then also include 3.37(c) statement and attach the assignment documents.

### Speficiation format

You can file the specification, claims, and abstract as three seperate Word (docx) documents. We will see how processing goes.

##  2. File by reference

This process can be a little confusing. Especially if you decide to change the title.

### Initial documents that you need to provide

- WebADS
- Fees
- Declaration(s)
- 3.73(c) if needed (see [373-c-statement](373-c-statement.md)).

### Followup documents

- Original specification

- Followup amendments to the claims
