Recommended Process and Documents to file a Continuation Application
================================================

Two ways to file a Continuation Application: 
1.  Regular method (preferred and slightly cheaper).
2.  File by reference (should be used for emergencies only).

##  1. Regular method (preferred and slightly cheaper)

This method is preferred because the filing process is pretty much the same as filing a new application.

### Documents

- Specification
  -  Written description w/ benefit claim
  -  New claims
- Drawings
- WebADS
- Declaration(s)
- Fees
- If the original application was filed before September 16, 2012, then also include 3.37(c) statement and attach the assignment documents.

##  2. File by reference

This process can be a little confusing. Especially if you decide to change the title.

### Initial documents that you need to provide

- WebADS
- Fees
- Declaration(s)
